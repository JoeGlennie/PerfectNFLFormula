First, I will post my formula's predictions for every game in week 6 (October 13-14, 2024). After that, I will post the NFL Elo model's predictions based on the ALC's spreads. I hypothesize that I will need to reduce my formula's reliance on scoring defense rating and increase the weighting for the opponents' coaching staff.

Team_Score = NFL_Elo_score + Coaching_Staff(out of 10) + Weather(out of 10)/5 - (33 - opponents scoring defense ranking)/4 - Opponent's_coaching_staff(out of 10)/2

October 13, 2024, 10:47 AM EST- Since the Giants' top wide receiver and running back will not be playing on Sunday, I believe the oddsmakers' prediction will be more accurate than my own. 



For this week's analysis, I will include the outliers. In future weeks, I may remove them.                               Margin of Error                           Margin of Error

                                                                                                                            -36.7                                      -56.75

I don't think calculating the net margin of error that way is helpful, so I also calculated the total margins of error.
                                                                                                                            195.40                                      199.75           
The ALC provides much better odds with the moneyline option than simply predicting the winner of each game. With moneyline, a team needs to win by at least four points. I've never been able to predict ties in football, so I will only predict outright winners. 

For week 6, I was able to predict 8 of the outright wins. The Elo model predicted 6 of the outright wins.

For week 7, I will probably adjust my forecasts if there are any last minute injury updates for superstars. 

It looks like I underestimated the scores for a lot of teams. For the most part, the formula worked well for predicting outright winners. It certainly won't work for hockey, so that just leaves football and basketball.

October 16, 2024- Since the Jets added Davante Adams a couple days ago, I have added my new projection to the right of my original prediction. 

So far, the only examples I've found online only work with binary outcomes, so I don't think machine learning will help predict the number of points teams will score.

9:55 AM ET, October 17, 2024- I updated the Saints output because their two good wide receivers have been ruled out.

It seems the formula is way too simple to be turned into a machine learning project. I noticed that lots of other people already completed machine learning projects to try to do the same thing. I think I would need to import all of the NFL's raw data from the past 100 years to need to complete all 600+ possible steps machine learning may require. 
                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                             +39.59                                        +43


For the time being, it doesn't seem like my formula is good enough to generate big profits. After each NBA team has played at least five games (so they can establish defensive rankings), I will check if the formula works better with basketball. Based on the margins of error from weeks 6 and 7, my formula barely works better than the NFL Elo model. I'm not going to post all of my predictions for week 8 because the formula forecast a lot of lopsided victories.


November 1, 2024- For week 8, I only predicted the right outcome for 10 of the 15 games. I did have a lower net margin of error than the Elo model, but not by much. So far, I have correctly predicted 

Through three weeks, I have correctly predicted the winner for 35 of the 43 games, which means the formula is 81.4% accurate. I'm really surprised it isn't good enough to generate a profit. I will probably start buying tickets that only have one game on them to gave the formula a chance to really prove itself. I will update this page after the week 9 results, and that will probably bring an end to the experiment.

I also used the same formula to make a couple basketball predictions:

November 2, 2024- It's clear the formula will need to be changed for basketball. I expect the divider for defense rating (4) will need to be lowered.

November 3, 2024- Since DK Metcalf and Noah Fant will not be playing later today, so I will be subtracting two points from the Seahawks' projected score. It sounds like Tee Higgins isn't going to play for the Bengals, so I will take two points off the Bengals score.

After reviewing the machine learning course material it sounds like I would have been better off calculating the mean squared error (MSE) instead of the net margin of error.
                                                                                                                             1666.78                                     1332.25
I think it's pretty clear that the NFL Elo model had a lower margin of the error in week 9 than my formula, but I will still calculate the MSE's just in case. The MSE for my formula for week 9 was sqrt((1666.78)/30) = 7.4538

MSE for NFL Elo model is sqrt((1332.25)/30) = 6.6640

November 4, 2024- Before the Monday night game, the formula has correctly predicted the winner for 47 of the 57 games, which means it's 82.4% accurate. It does a terrible job predicting basketball games, which is extremely disappointing. 

November 5, 2024- After the Monday night game, the formula achieved 82.8% accuracy. So far, it only predicts the correct outcome in 35% of NBA games, so I think I'll need to add several variables and remove the opponent's defesnvie scoring ranking.

November 5, 2024- After reviewing the details of the basketball scores, it seems like the projected totals for each team provided by the ALC were way off the mark. I hope I can find a more accurate source for projections.
For the NBA games on November 6th, I will use the team scores from their last games to see if it leads to far more accurate predictions.

I used information from www.teamrankings.com and www.foxsports.com/nba/scores to calculate scores for November 6, 2024. I used the average score from each team's last three games to see if I could use the same formula but obtain more accurate results.

November 6, 2024- This will be the final week I post my predictions for NFL games. No one has looked at this page, and I'm going to switch my focus to basketball because there's way more potential to make money.

November 7, 2024- I updated the Thursday night forecast due to Tee Higgins probable absence, Likely's absence, and Lamar Jackson's knee issue.

November 10, 2024- I think it's pretty obvious the Elo model did a much better job predicting scores this week, so I won't bother calculating Mean Squared Error.

November 8, 2024- For last night's NBA games, I stopped using the formula and just subtracted points from the oddsmakers' predictions for teams that were playing on back to back nights.

Bulls          103.25                   110.25                                     119                                 -15.75

Trailblazers   111.5                    111.5                                      105                                  +6.5
Spurs          111                      116                                        118                                  -7.0

Jazz           110                      110                                        100                                  +10
Bucks          119                      119                                        123                                  -4.0

I don't need to calculate the margins of error because the Foxsports oddsmakers did an excellent job predicting scores last night. In the future, I will subtract 2 points instead of 5 for teams plaing back to back games and 1 point for travel.

After factoring in fatigue, my formula would've yielded the following scores:

Timberwolves  123.15
Bulls         107.15 

Trailblazers   110.1
Spurs          115.35
 
Jazz           111.65
Bucks          123.4


November 8, 2024- I'm using the formula again with Fox Sports' projections.

Pacers         125.9                   121.5                                       83                                  +42.9                                          +38.5
Hornets        117.65                  115                                         103                                +14.65                                           +12

Hawks          112.45                  113                                         121                                -8.55                                           -8.0
Pistons        118.2                   114.5                                       122                                -3.8                                            -7.5

Bucks          109.58                  108.5                                       94                                 +15.58                                          +14.5
Knicks         117.33                  115                                         116                                +1.33                                           -1.0

Suns           114.22                  115                                         114                                +0.22                                           +1.0
Mavericks      119.3                   117.5                                       113                                +6.3                                            +4.5


Mean_Square_Error = [x**2 + x**2 + x**2 + x**2] / 4

Average_Mean_Square_Error = sqrt(Mean_Square_Error)

November 8, 2024- The results above show the formula is still way off with basketball predictions. I will look for variables that are more closely connected to total points scored.

November 9, 2024- I updated the Commanders score because Brian Robinson Jr. won't be playing on Sunday.
I'm completely lost wih basketball, so I'll start from scratch. For today, I will use the following formula: 

Team_Points = Points_Per_Game + Team_Field_Goal_Made_Percentage - Opponent_Field_Goal_Made_Percentage

Jazz           99.8                    112.5                                      111
Spurs         110.4                    119.0                                      110

Nets           106                     104.25                                     105
Cavaliers      128                     117.25                                     110

Bulls          112.3                   117.25                                     125
Hawks          117.8                   119.25                                     113

Raptors        118.7                   109.5                                      103
Clippers       108.2                   116.0                                      105

I subtracted 2 points from the Cavaliers total score because they are playing back to back games. I used Fox Sports's predcitions for comparison. I really doubt the Raptors are going to beat the Clippers by 10, but we'll see.

November 10, 2024- For the time being, I'm going to stop picking basketball games since any formula I create has is at most 40% accurate.
